## Motivation

We all know how hard it is to maintain a neat and organised folder. Especially when the number of files present is high, it becomes messy and hard to keep track of files. 

I built this application to specifically solve that problem. With File-Sorter you can easily sort your files into dedicated folders based on the type of the file. It makes organisation easy and saves a lot of time.

## Installation

For the latest stable version, head to [Releases](https://github.com/SVijayB/File-Sorter/releases).

Download and extract the source code.

As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using,

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/File-Sorter.git
</pre>

## Usage

Run the `File-Sorter.py` file present in the `src` folder.

You can do that by just double clicking on the file if you have the *python launcher* installed. Else, **`cd/`** to the **`src`** folder and type `python File-Sorter.py` on your terminal.

Now, copy the address of the folder you want to organise/sort. Eg : `C:\Users\Username\Documents`

Paste it in the application and hit enter. You will be notified once the files are sorted.

The application comes pre-built with a set of extensions for diferent categories. However, if you wish to add a new category or a new extension. Launch the `Update.py` file present in the `src` folder using the steps mentioned above.

Using the **Update.py** file you can,
- Add an extension
- Add a new category
- Delete an extension
- View extensions

If you wish to reset the collection of extensions back to its default state (When installed), just launch the `Reset.py` file present in the `src` folder.
